## Version Control Strategy

All content and Docusaurus configuration are managed under Git version control.

*   **Repository**: The entire Docusaurus project resides within the main project repository.
*   **Branching**: Feature development follows a branching model (e.g., Git Flow or GitHub Flow), where each new feature or significant content addition is developed on a separate branch (e.g., `feature/001-my-new-lesson`).
*   **Commits**: Changes should be committed frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages.
*   **Pull Requests (PRs)**: All changes are reviewed via Pull Requests before being merged into the main branch (`main`).
*   **Content History**: The full history of content changes is maintained within the Git repository.
*   **Releases**: Documentation releases will correspond with specific Git tags or main branch commits.
